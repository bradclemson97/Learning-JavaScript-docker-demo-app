## demo app - developing with Docker

This demo app shows a simple user profile app set up using 
- index.html with pure js and css styles
- nodejs backend with express module
- mongodb for data storage

All components are docker-based

### With Docker

#### To start the application

Step 1: Create docker network

    docker network create mongo-network 

Step 2: start mongodb 

    docker run -d -p 27017:27017 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password --name mongodb --net mongo-network mongo   
    
_NOTE: default ports are used for mondodb and mongo-express_    
    
Step 3: start mongo-express
    
    docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=password --net mongo-network --name mongo-express -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb mongo-express   

_NOTE: creating docker-network in optional. You can start both containers in a default network. In this case, just emit `--net` flag in `docker run` command_

Step 4: open mongo-express from browser

    http://localhost:8081

Step 5: create `user-account` _db_ and `users` _collection_ in mongo-express

Step 6: Start your nodejs application locally - go to `app` directory of project 

    npm install 
    node server.js
    
Step 7: Access you nodejs application UI from browser

    http://localhost:3000

### With Docker Compose

As opposed to manually running each command for the containers, as shown above, if we have two or more containers we can write all the run commands for the two or more containers in a single docker compose file. 

#### To start the application

Step 1: start mongodb and mongo-express

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up
    
_You can access the mongo-express under localhost:8080 from your browser_
    
Step 2: in mongo-express UI - create a new database "my-db"

Step 3: in mongo-express UI - create a new collection "users" in the database "my-db"       
    
Step 4: start node server 

    npm install
    node server.js
    
Step 5: access the nodejs application from browser 

    http://localhost:3000

#### To build a docker image from the application

We create a docker image to deploy our application to a chosen envrionment. 

    docker build -t my-app:1.0 .       
    
The dot "." at the end of the command denotes location of the Dockerfile. Bceause we are in the same folder as the Dockerfile we use the current directory ('.'). If using Jenkins for CI, Jenkins would build our Docker image based on our Dockerfile. This image would then be pushed to the docker repository to make it available to use - see Workflow_with_docker.PNG

_NOTE: Whenever you adjust the Dockerfile, you MUST remove the old image and rebuild!_

To remove a docker image.

    docker rmi 'IMAGE ID'
